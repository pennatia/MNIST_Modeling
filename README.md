# MNIST_Modeling
A quick Data Science showcase project implementing various algorithms to analyze &amp; model with the MNIST dataset. 

This project aims at using some of the implementations found in the ML from Scratch repository to create a model for the prediction of MNIST handdrawn digits. 

# Methods explored
The following methods were explored in the creation of the above notebook. 
- Mahalanobis Distance
- Feature Reduction
- Principle Component Analysis
- Parzen Windows
- Linear Discriminant Analysis

# Scope
This project was conducted as part of coursework for my MSc in Data Science.
